## Safety Warning and Disclaimer

You are using this software at your own risk. The authors decline any responsibility for personal injuries and/or property damage.

Some drones supported by this framework ARE NOT TOYS. Even operation by expert users might cause SERIOUS INJURIES to people around. So, please consider flying in a properly screened or isolated flight area.

## Aerostack

We present a cost-effective framework for the prototyping of vision-based quadrotor multi-robot systems, which core characteristics are: modularity, compatibility with different platforms and being flight-proven. The framework is fully operative and based on [ROS](http://ros.org/ "Robot Operating System"). It works in simulation and in real flight tests of up to 5 drones, and was firstly introduced and demonstrated during our participation in the 2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Indoor Flight Competition [IMAV2013](http://www.imav2013.org/ "2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Indoor Flight Competition") (Toulouse, France).

Please visit our webpage for more information: [http://www.aerostack.org/](http://www.aerostack.org/ "http://www.aerostack.org/")

The current distribution supports the usage of mutiple aerial platdorms, including, but not limited to:

- Parrot AR Drone 1.0 & 2.0.
- Asctec Pelican
- Mikrokopter Oktokopter
- Pixhawk 
- Bebop drone/Ardrone 3 (currently under development)

## Installation

### Pre-requirements 

This driver has been tested on Linux machines running Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit). However it should also work on any other mainstream Linux distributions. The driver has been tested on ROS "Jade". The code requires a compiler that is compatible with the C++11 standard. Additional required libraries are: boost and ncurses. The ROS package depends on these ROS packages: `ardrone_autonomy`, `opencv2`, `roscpp`, `image_transport`, `sensor_msgs` and `std_srvs`.

### Installation Steps

The installation follows the same steps needed usually to compile a self-contained ROS stack.

#### Download the installation script file

        git clone https://bitbucket.org/joselusl/aerostack_installer ~/temp
    
#### Run it in a non-ARM Architecture Computer with Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Jade
       
        ~/temp/installation_script.sh
  
#### Re-open the Terminal and the Aerostack is ready to be used. 
    
      
## How to Run

Please, visit [http://www.aerostack.org/](http://www.aerostack.org/ "http://www.aerostack.org/") for an updated documentation.

### Network setup

For network setup please refer to $DRONE_STACK/documentation/configureNetwork/LAN_GroundStations_Setup.txt.
NOTE: There is no need of a network setup when using an Ardrone as it can be connected directly to the groundstation using WIFI.

### Launch scripts

NOT UPDATED!

In order to launch files particular to a drone there are launch files provided for each drone inside $DRONE_STACK/launchers. 
For example, for launching ARdrone2 there are launch files present inside $DRONE_STACK/launchers/ardrone_launch. The launching instruction can for the ardrone can be found in a file called ardrone_realflight_instructions.md inside this same folder. 

NOTE: Screen needs to be installed for launching these files using screen which can be installed by sudo apt-get install screen. 
Also it is recommended not to launch the interface using screen and it should be launhced in a seperate terminal using the following command
${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/ardrone_launch/sh_files/run_interface_node.sh.

For launching an complete autonoumous mission using Ardrone2, please refer to $DRONE_STACK/documentation/launch_scripts.txt. 

### Basic Commands

NOT UPDATED!

For running an complete mission the launch scripts have to be called using the following syntax in the shell terminal: 

        ```bash
        $ cd ${DRONE_STACK}/launchers/Noche_de_los_investigadores
        $ quadrotor_laNocheInvestigadores.sh NUMID_DRONE NETWORK_ROSCORE DRONE_IP DRONE_WIFI_CHANNEL
        ```

### Architecture, Map and Mission configuration

NOT UPDATED!

Check the `${DRONE_STACK}/documentation/matlab_dependencies.txt` file to understand how to configure a mission. More specifically, after adding the related Matlab libraries to your Matlab path, check the following files:
	`${DRONE_STACK}/configs/Mission_10b/script_Mission10b_Generator.m`, 
	`${DRONE_STACK}/configs/Mission_11c/script_Mission11c_Generator.m`, 
	`${DRONE_STACK}/configs/Mission_IMAV13/script_IMAV13_Generator.m` .
Once you run these scripts, copy the created drone${NUMID\_DRONE} configuration folders to the ${DRONE_STACK}/configs folder.

### Complete mission execution

NOT UPDATED!

After launching all required launch files in order to start the mission type in a new terminal 
  `rosservice call /drone{NUMID_DRONE}/droneMissionScheduleProcessorROSModule/start` 

### Navigation with console UI

NOT UPDATED!

The drone Interface is the screen which shows all the data regarding the drone example the battery status, rotation angles etc. The user can also give manual commands to the drone using the drone interface

The keybindings of the interface are specified in the file: `${DRONE_STACK}/HMI/droneInterfaceROSModule/other/keybindings_interfacejp_tentative.txt`; and are programmed in the following source file: `${DRONE_STACK}/droneInterfaceROSModule/src/sources/droneInterface_jp_ROSModuleNode.cpp` . 

If something goes wrong during the execution of the mission the user can always make the drone land or hover by giving commands using the interface.
